# Parameterized Key Tester Frame

## Why this fork exists

I wanted to generate a 2x7 key tester, but I couldn't get the original program to do that properly.
The walls got kind of misaligned. All this fork does is mess with some numbers to make the walls
aligned with the edges of the key tester plate.

## Usage

Don't use this fork lmao...
Unless you need a 2x7 tester, in which case you can check out the files folder.

Go to whitelynx' original program for any layout other than 2x7.
